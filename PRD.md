# **Product Requirements Document (PRD): ESP32-CAM Smart Camera System**

## **1\. Project Overview**

The ESP32-CAM Smart Camera is a low-cost, open-source project designed for home monitoring and basic IoT surveillance applications. It aims to provide users with the ability to remotely view a live video feed, capture still images, and potentially integrate with other smart home systems. The primary focus is on affordability, ease of setup for hobbyists, and core camera functionalities.

## **2\. User Persona(s)**

* **Name:** The DIY Home Monitor  
* **Background:** A tech-savvy individual or hobbyist interested in building custom smart home solutions. They have some experience with microcontrollers (like Arduino or ESP32) and basic coding.  
* **Needs:**  
  * An affordable alternative to commercial security cameras.  
  * Ability to monitor specific areas (e.g., pet activity, front door, workshop).  
  * Flexibility to customize features and integrate with other DIY projects.  
  * Access to live video feed and snapshots from a web browser or simple application.  
* **Goals:** To set up a reliable, low-power camera system that can provide visual insights into a chosen environment.

## **3\. Goals & Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:** To develop a functional ESP32-CAM system capable of live video streaming and still image capture over Wi-Fi.  
* **Key Objectives:**  
  * Achieve stable Wi-Fi connectivity.  
  * Implement a robust web server on the ESP32-CAM.  
  * Provide a user-friendly web interface for viewing the stream and taking snapshots.  
  * Ensure the system operates reliably with a standard power supply.

## **4\. Features & Functionality**

### **4.1. Required Features (Minimum Viable Product \- MVP)**

* **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** The device must connect to a pre-configured Wi-Fi network (SSID and password).  
* **Live Video Streaming:**  
  * Provide a continuous video stream accessible via a web browser on the local network.  
  * The stream should be viewable on common desktop and mobile browsers.  
* **Still Image Capture:**  
  * Allow users to trigger a high-resolution snapshot via the web interface.  
  * Display the captured image on the web page or offer a download option.  
* **Basic Configuration:**  
  * Ability to set Wi-Fi credentials through code.  
  * Basic camera settings (resolution, quality) configurable in code.

### **4.2. Optional Features (Future Enhancements / Phase 3\)**

* **SD Card Storage:**  
  * Save captured still images to a microSD card.  
  * Option to record short video clips to the SD card.  
* **Motion Detection:**  
  * Implement a basic motion detection algorithm.  
  * Trigger an action (e.g., take a snapshot, send an alert) upon motion detection.  
* **External Integration (HTTP/HTTPS):**  
  * Send captured images or alerts to a defined HTTP/HTTPS endpoint (e.g., a cloud storage service, a notification API).  
* **Over-The-Air (OTA) Updates:**  
  * Allow firmware updates wirelessly without needing a physical connection.  
* **User Interface Enhancements:**  
  * More intuitive web interface with additional controls (e.g., LED flash toggle).

## **5\. User Stories**

* **As a user, I want to power on the ESP32-CAM and have it automatically connect to my home Wi-Fi network so I can access it remotely.**  
* **As a user, I want to type the ESP32-CAM's IP address into my web browser and immediately see a live video feed so I can monitor my space.**  
* **As a user, I want to click a "Take Snapshot" button on the web interface so I can capture a high-resolution image of the current view.**  
* **As a user, I want to be able to save the captured image to an SD card so I have a local record.** (Optional)  
* **As a user, I want the camera to detect movement and automatically send me a notification (e.g., via email or a custom API) with a snapshot so I'm alerted to activity.** (Optional)

## **6\. Technical Specifications & Constraints**

* **Microcontroller:** ESP32-CAM module (ESP32-S or ESP32-D series, with 4MB PSRAM recommended for streaming).  
* **Camera Module:** OV2640 (default, 2MP).  
* **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n.  
* **Power:** 5V DC via USB-C or dedicated 5V pin.  
* **Live Stream Frame Rate:** Target a minimum of 5 FPS for smooth viewing, aiming for higher where network conditions allow.  
* **Image Resolution:**  
  * Streaming: QVGA (320x240) or VGA (640x480) for efficiency.  
  * Snapshots: UXGA (1600x1200) or SVGA (800x600).  
* **Storage:** microSD card slot (up to 32GB supported).  
* **Development Environment:** VS Code with PlatformIO IDE.  
* **Framework:** Arduino for ESP32.  
* **Security:** Basic Wi-Fi security (WPA2-PSK). No advanced authentication mechanisms for the web server in the MVP.  
* **Cost Constraint:** Keep hardware costs minimal, leveraging the ESP32-CAM's affordability.
